Auctioneer bot for the game Super Snail, which has an auction feature after each Species War completes.

# What it does

Watches for all reactions to all messages (TODO: in a specific channel?).

If they are specific reactions (:one:, :two:, :three:) to messages related to a running auction, then updates the message with the new information.

# Discord commands

* **start**: starts a new auction
* **stop**: stops the current auction, if any
* **exit**: shut down the bot
